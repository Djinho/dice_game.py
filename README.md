# Dice Game with Dynamic Scoring

This Python-based game offers a unique twist on traditional dice games, incorporating dynamic scoring and the option for players to take risks for potential high rewards. Developed by Djinho Itshary, the game is designed for 2-4 players, each taking turns to roll a die with the option to double their roll at an increased risk of scoring nothing.

## Features

- **Dynamic Player Entry**: Accommodates 2-4 players, with dynamic name entry for personalized gameplay.
- **Double Roll Option**: Players can choose to double their roll for the chance to double their score, but with a 15% increased risk of rolling a 1, which would end their turn without scoring.
- **Adaptive Scoring**: The game continues until one player reaches or exceeds the maximum score of 75, making for an exciting and unpredictable gameplay experience.
